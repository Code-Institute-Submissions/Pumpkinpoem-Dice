### Features Left to Implement

- Gallery page for live events and a quiz form for fun.

## Testing 

- Admin Tools: I used Admin tools to review the code and ensure that it was working as intended on both the test site and the deployed site.
- Cross-Browser Compatibility Testing: I tested the code on various web browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) to ensure compatibility and consistent performance across different platforms.
- Responsive Design Testing: I checked the responsiveness of the website by testing it on different devices (desktop, tablet, mobile) to ensure proper rendering and usability across various screen sizes.
- User Experience Testing: I conducted usability testing to evaluate the overall user experience, including navigation, interaction flow, and accessibility features.

### Validator Testing 

- HTML:
  - One error was returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fpumpkinpoem.github.io%2FDice%2Fsignup.html).
- CSS:
  - No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?lang=en&profile=css3svg&uri=https%3A%2F%2Fpumpkinpoem.github.io%2FDice%2Findex.html&usermedium=all&vextwarning=&warning=1).

### Unfixed Bugs

- I have not fixed the validator error for the Alt text.
- The white lines on the Welcome section are supposed to be black, but when I make them black, white still shows, and I didn't manage to fix it.

## Deployment 

- The site was deployed to GitHub Pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab. 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch.
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
